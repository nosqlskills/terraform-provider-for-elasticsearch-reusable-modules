  source = "git::https://github.com/your-username/terraform-[module-name].git"
  # Add any required variables here
}
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

Here's a basic example of how to use the module:

```hcl
module "example" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/your-username/terraform-[module-name].git"
  
  # Example variables
  variable1 = "value1"
  variable2 = "value2"
}
```

### Advanced Usage

For more advanced use cases, you can customize the module by configuring additional parameters. Here's an example:

```hcl
module "example_advanced" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/your-username/terraform-[module-name].git"
  
  # Advanced configuration
  variable1 = "custom_value1"
  variable2 = "custom_value2"
  variable3 = "custom_value3"
  # Add more customization options as needed
}
```
